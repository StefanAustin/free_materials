# Free materials and certs

If you want to go into cybersecurity, at the beginning, you do not need money. Do the first things with free resources and if you like it, than spend money on certs.
Some certs are free, like AZ-900 (Azure fundamentals) if you attend a free seminar with Microsoft Training Days.

## Ways to use this list

To make money, you need a goal, you should do something what you like and you need available jobs. Jobs are bound to an area. If you do not want to move and a job is not available, it does not make much sense to learn it. Remote jobs are available, but few for an entry level position.

### The us say you are going into the red side (pen testing):

-> INEs starter pass is great. Free labs and 1500 slides. You learn the basics in ethical hacking for free. If you like it, you can add The Cyber Mentors Zero to Hero course on YouTube. Sign up for tryhackme, HTB, etc ($10 a month). You want to make a carrer out of it? At this point you have to spend money for a real cert. OSCP is helpful to get a job, but it is about $1350.  Alternative: INE and their courses, but only if you do more than one cert in a year. 

### The blue side:

-> The blue side has more jobs and you can start with Rangeforce free labs (https://go.rangeforce.com/free-cyber-security-training-community-edition). You will need a couple of days to learn everything. It is a SOC and tool introduction with hands-on labs. You can move on with the free splunk course to add more knowledge with a SIEM. If you like it, download Security Onion and start Boss of the SOC, Chris Long Detection Labs, cyberdefenders, etc. You want to make a career out of it? You can spend money: BTL1 is an option (~$700) or RangeForce certs (I do not know the price). 

LetsDefend is also a great place to start, if you want to get a SOC Analyst job (https://letsdefend.io/)

Seach for games like https://threatgen.com/ if you like to play.
